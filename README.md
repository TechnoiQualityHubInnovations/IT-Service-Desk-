# Application Backend Overview ( Sharepoint, PowerAutomate)
 - IT service desk management app is designed using Power Automate flows and SharePoint in the backend. It allows users to create automated workflows across various applications and services.

 - By using Power Automate flows and SharePoint in the backend, organizations can create a custom IT service desk management app that integrates with other Microsoft      services, such as Microsoft Teams, Power BI, and Outlook.Â It also provides a centralized location for collaboration and communication between team members.
   
 # Security and Privacy 
 - The ITSM app supports Single Sign-On authentication, which allows users to log in using their existing credentials and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
 - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is also available, which enables administrators to define user roles and permissions to ensure that sensitive data is only            accessible to authorized personnel.
 - The app employs best practices for data encryption and protection and adheres to industry-standard security protocols to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and    availability of data. This includes measures such as secure socket layer (SSL) encryption, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and regular vulnerability assessments    and penetration testing.
